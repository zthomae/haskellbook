1. max (length [1, 2, 3]) (length [8, 9, 10, 11, 12])

This should work and result in a value of 5.

2. compare (3 * 4) (3 * 5)

This should work and result in a value of LT

3. compare "Julie" True

This should not work -- [Char] and Bool are incompatible
types.

4. (5 + 3) > (3 + 6)

This should work and evaluate to False
