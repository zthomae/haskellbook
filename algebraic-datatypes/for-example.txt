Given

data Example = MakeExample deriving Show

1. What is the type of MakeExample?

Example.

What happens when you request the type of Example?

It doesn't work -- Example isn't a data constructor. (You may want the kind.)

2. What if you try :info on Example?

This shows us the definition and typeclass instances, namely Show.

Prelude> :i Example
data Example = MyExample        -- Defined at <interactive>:26:1
instance Show Example -- Defined at <interactive>:26:35

3. A unary variant:

data MyOtherExample = MakeOtherExample Int

The type of MakeOtherExample is now Int -> MyOtherExample
