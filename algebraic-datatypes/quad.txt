Determine how many unique inhabitants each type has

data Quad
  = One
  | Two
  | Three
  | Four
  deriving (Eq, Show)

1. eQuad :: Either Quad Quad has 4+4 = 8 inhabitants

2. prodQuad :: (Quad, Quad) has 4*4 = 16 inhabitants

3. funcQuad :: Quad -> Quad has 4^4 = 256 inhabitants

4. prodTBool :: (Bool, Bool, Bool) has 2^3 = 8 inhabitants

5. gTwo :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool has (2^2)^2 = 16 inhabitants

6. fTwo :: Bool -> Quad -> Quad has (2^4)^4 = 65536 inhabitants

Note that the exponentiation is left associative...
