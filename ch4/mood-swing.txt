data Mood = Blah | Woot deriving Show

1. The type constructor is Mood

2. If a function requires a Mood argument,
the values you could use are Blah and Woot.

3. Suppose we have the type signature
changeMood :: Mood -> Woot

This is incorrect because Woot is a data
constructor, not a type. The type of Woot
is still Mood.

4. To invert a mood:

changeMood :: Mood -> Mood
changeMood Blah = Woot
changeMood _ = Blah
