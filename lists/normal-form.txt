Determine whether each of the following are in

1) normal form, which implies weak head normal form
2) weak head normal form only, or
3) neither

Remember that an expression cannot be in normal form
or weak head normal form if the outermost part of
the expression isn't a data constructor. It can't be
in normal form if any part of the expression is
unevaluated.

NOTE TO SELF: I don't think I entirely understand this.

1. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

normal form

2. 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : _

weak head normal form

3. enumFromTo 1 10

neither. what it evaluates to is in weak head normal form.

4. length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

neither

5. sum (enumFromTo 1 10)

neither.

6. ['a'..'m'] ++ ['n'..'z']

neither

7. (_, 'b')

weak head normal form (, is the data constructor)
