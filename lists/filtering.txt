1. Write a function to give all multiples of 3
out of a list from 1 to 30

filter (\x -> (rem x 3) == 0) [1..30]

2. How could we compose the above function with
the length function to tell us how many multiples
of 3 there are between 1 and 30?

(length . (filter (\x -> (rem x 3) == 0))) [1..30]

3. Remove the articles ("the", "a", and "and") from
sentences

myFilter :: String -> [String]
myFilter s =
  (filter (\w -> not (elem w ["the", "a", "and"]))) $ words s
