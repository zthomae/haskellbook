1. Modify your fibs function to only return the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.

I can do better than that:

fibs :: Num a => [a]
fibs = 0 : scanl (+) 1 fibs

nFibs :: Num a => Int -> [a]
nFibs n = take n fibs

2. Modify fibs to return the Fibonacci numbers that are less than 100:

fibsUpto :: Num a => a -> [a]
fibsUpto n = takeWhile (<n) fibs

3. Try to write the factorial function as a scan. You'll want scanl,
and your start value will be 1.

factorial :: Num a => a
factorial = scanl (*) 1 (enumFrom 2)
