1)

a) 8 + 7 * 9
b) (8 + 7) * 9

Yes, the parens change the result -- * has precedence over +

2)

a) perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
b) perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2

No, the parens don't change the result

3)

a) f x = x / 2 + 9
b) f x = x / (2 * 9)

Yes, the parens change the result -- / has the same
precedence as *, which is higher than +
