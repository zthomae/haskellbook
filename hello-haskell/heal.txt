1)

let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)

The problem is the space between 3. and 14. Corrected:

let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)

2) let double x = b * 2

The problem is that b is a free variable that is presumably
not defined at the moment. It was intended to be x:

let double x = x * 2

3)

x = 7
 y = 10
f = x + y

The problem is that y is not indented at the same level
as the other definitions. Correct it by unindenting it
one space:

x = 7
y = 10
f = x + y
