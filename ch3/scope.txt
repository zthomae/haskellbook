1. Suppose you have the following REPL session:

let x = 5
let y = 7
let z = x + y

Is y in scope for z? Yes.

2.

let f = 3
let g = 6 * f + h

Is h in scope for g? No.

3. Is everything we need to execute area in scope?

area d = pi * (r * r)
r = d / 2

Even though r is defined after area, it is in scope.
However, d is not in scope for the definition of r.

4. Suppose we fix it:

area d = pi * (r * r)
  where r = d / 2

Now everything we need is in scope.
