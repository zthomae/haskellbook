1. Given the following declarations:

k (x, y) = x
k1 = k ((4-1), 10)
k2 = k ("three", (1 + 2))
k3 = k (3, True)

a) The type of k is (a, b) -> a
b) The type of k2 is String. This is not the same
as k1 and k3, both of which are Num a => a
c) k1 and k3 will return the number 3

2.

f :: (a, b, c) -> (d, e, f) -> ((a, d), (c, f))
f (a, b, c) (d, e, f) = ((a, d), (c, f))
