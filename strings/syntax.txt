Decide whether the following will compile.

1. ++ [1,2,3] [4,5,6]

No -- to use ++ as a prefix, it must be surrounded
by parentheses.

2. '<3' ++ ' Haskell'

Yes.

3. concat ["<3", " Haskell"]

We pass concat a list of lists (of chars), and it
combines them to form a single list of chars. This
compiles.
