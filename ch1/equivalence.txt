Given a labmda expression, choose an answer that is
equivalent

1. \xy.xz

a) \xz.xz

In the given expression, z is a free variable. Here it is
bound. The expressions are not equivalent.

b) \mn.mz

Here we have substituted x with m and y with n. z is still
a free variable. This is equivalent.

c) \z(\x.xz)

This is equivalent to \zx.xz. It's clearly not the same.

2. \xy.xxy

a) \mn.mnp

Creating an alpha-equivalent version of this expression using
x and y will make it obvious that it is not the same:

\xy.xyp

b) \x(\y.xy)

This is the desugared version of \xy.xy.

\a(\b.aab)

The original expression can be desugared to be
\x(\y.xxy). The two expressions are clearly alpha-equivalent.

3. \xyz.zx

a) \x.(\y.(\z.z))

Nope. z is not applied to x.

b) \tos.st

This is obviously alpha equivalent to the original.

c) \mnp.mn

This is equivalent to \xyz.xy -- clearly different.
