1. Given the datatype

data BigSmall =
    Big Bool
  | Small Bool
  deriving (Eq, Show)

What is the cardinality of this datatype?

We know that the cardinality of Bool is 2. Since there are two data
constructors taking a Bool argument, the cardinality must be 4.

2. Given a datatype

-- needed to have Int8 in scope
import Data.Int

data NumberOrBool =
    Numba Int8
  | BoolyBool Bool
  deriving (Eq, Show)

What is the cardinality of this datatype?

Int8 has a cardinality of 256. Bool has a cardinality of 2. Therefore,
NumberOrBool has a cardinality of 258.
