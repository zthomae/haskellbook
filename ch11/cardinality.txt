Make a guess as to the cardinality -- the number of possible values it defines --
for each of the following:

1. data PugType = PugData: 1

2. data AirLine = PapuAir | CatapultsR'Us | TakeYourChancesUnited: 3

3. The cardinality of Int8 is 256, or 2^8. Similarly, the cardinality of Int16
is 2^16, or 65536

4. The cardinality of Int can be found by doing

abs (toInteger (minBound :: Int)) + toInteger (maxBound :: Int) + 1

This gives us 18446744073709551616, which happens to be 2^64.

minBound and maxBound don't have instances for Integer, because this is an
arbitrary-precision type. Therefore, the cardinality of Integer is infinite.

5. What's the connection between the 8 in Int8 and the type's cardinality of
256? Read the answer to #3 to find out!
